# randomizer
This extension randomly plays an album from your album list on this page: https://open.spotify.com/collection/albums

The caveat is that this script only interacts with the albums currently loaded onto that page. If you have not scrolled to the bottom of your album list to load all albums into the web page, this script will only randomly play the things you have loaded so far.

As of 0.0.0.3, there is an option in the right click menu to reorder the albums by artist, since Spotify changed the ordering for some unknown reason. This has the same caveat as above, and only interacts with the albums loaded on the page.

0.0.0.5 adds a right click option to scroll to the bottom of your album list for you.
